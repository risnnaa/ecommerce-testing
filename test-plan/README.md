Test Plan is Strategy for testing the whole feature/project.
When creating a test plan, you need to pay attention to the following aspects:
- Test Objectives → Clearly define what the testing aims to achieve.
- Scope of Testing → Specify what is included and excluded from the test.
- Test Approach & Strategy → Describe how testing will be conducted (manual, automation, functional, non-functional, exploratory, etc.).
- Test Items / Features → List the features, modules, or components to be tested.
- Test Deliverables → Identify the documents and reports that will be produced (test cases, execution results, defect reports, summary report).
- Testing Environment → Define the hardware, software, browsers, devices, and network conditions to be used.
- Resources & Responsibilities → Specify who will perform the testing and their roles.
- Schedule & Timeline → Provide a timeline for test preparation, execution, retesting, and reporting.
- Risks & Mitigation → Highlight potential risks and how to address them.
- Entry & Exit Criteria → Define conditions to start testing and criteria to consider testing complete.
